# SaturnClient Project Documentation

## Overview

SaturnClient is a desktop client application implemented in C# to interface with the SaturnService. It fetches and processes NFL team statistics, displaying the data in a user-friendly format. The application is designed with object-oriented principles to ensure robustness and maintainability.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Provides a graphical interface for users to view NFL team statistics.
- **Data Retrieval**: Communicates with SaturnService to fetch data asynchronously.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implements a retry policy for robust error handling and data fetching resilience.
- **Logging**: Incorporates logging for monitoring operations and errors.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Language**: The client is implemented in C#, an object-oriented programming language.
2. **Robustness**: The system is designed to handle unexpected inputs seamlessly.
3. **System Design**: Utilizes object-oriented design principles for flexibility and clarity.
4. **Maintainability**: Detailed module documentation and maintenance history are provided for easy system maintenance.
5. **Reusability**: The architecture encourages reusability through modular and cohesive design.

## Client Operation

Upon launch, the application performs the following operations:
1. Sends requests to enqueue team data for processing.
2. Retrieves and displays the processed team data.

## Error Handling

The client has a robust error handling strategy, including:
- A retry policy for transient failures.
- Comprehensive logging to facilitate troubleshooting.

## Reusability and Extensibility

With its modular design, SaturnClient can be extended to include more features or integrate with other services in the future.

## Service Repository

The SaturnService codebase is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed at the following repository:

## Design and Implementation

### Client Architecture

The client's architecture includes several key components:
- **MainWindow**: Serves as the primary interface for user interaction.
- **RetryPolicy**: Provides a mechanism to retry operations based on specific conditions.
- **TeamStat**: Represents the data structure for NFL team statistics.
